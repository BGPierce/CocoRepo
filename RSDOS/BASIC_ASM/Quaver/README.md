# Quaver 1.0 & 2.3

Quaver 1.0 & 2.3 by Dennis Kitsz

Quaver 1.0 is a 4 voice wavetable music sequencer for Coco 1 & 2 with at least 32k and EXTENDED COLOR BASIC. The Quaver 2.3 enhancement adds some new features include some special effects.

Quaver was sent to me by Dennis Kitsz himself to post publicly.

Quaver should assemble with most Color Computer assemblers, partivularly EDTASM+. The BASIC portion of the program is presented here in ASCII format for easy editing and downloading.

Enjoy!
