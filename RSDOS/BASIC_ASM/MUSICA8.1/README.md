# Musica II 8.1

Musica II 8.1 by Lester Hands

Musica II 8.1 is a 4 voice wavetable music sequencer for Coco 1, 2, & 3 with at least 32k and EXTENDED COLOR BASIC.

Musica II 8.1 assembles with Roger Taylor's CCASM in his RainbowIDE. The assembley code has some embedded BASIC code that is inserted into the Coco's BASIC workspace when loaded. The BASIC routines handle most of the disk I/O. All music editing and playing is done from within the machine language code portion of the software.

Enjoy!
