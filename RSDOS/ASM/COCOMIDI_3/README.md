# CocoMIDI 3

CocoMIDI 3 by Lester Hands

CocoMIDI 3 is a MIDI recorder/sequencer for the Tandy Color Computer 3 (RSDOS). CocoMIDI 3 allows you to record and edit 16 MIDI channels using the Speech Systems MIDI Pak (or the Glenside MIDI Pak).

CocoMIDI 3 compiles with the Tom Mix "MAS Editor/Assembler". I hope to soon convert this for EDTASM or Roger Taylor's CCASM

Enjoy!
