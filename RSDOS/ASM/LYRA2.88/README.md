# Lyra 2.88

Lyra 2.88 by Lester Hands

Lyra is an 8 channel MIDI sequencer for Color Computer 2 & 3 (RSDOS), featuring a point-n-click interface using a graphical representation of the Grand Piano Staff.

Lester Hand's last release of Lyra was v2.62. This version (v2.88) was enhanced with Lester's permission by Robert Gault to allow playing through the Drivewire4 onboard MIDI synth. V2.88 will also read from HDBDOS/RGBDOS 256 drive partitions.

Lyra 2.88 can be assembled using Roger Taylor's CCASM in his RainbowIDE.

Enjoy!
