# Dungeons of Daggorath

Dungeons of Daggorath by Douglas J. Morgan

Dungeons of Daggarath is probably one of the Color Computer's most popular games. Originally distributed in program pack only.

The code contained in this file is not the original source code to Dungeons of Daggorath. It was constructed by William Astle in 2013 by disassembling the Dungeons of Daggorath ROM.

Dungeons of Daggorath can be assembled into an 8k ROM using the LWTools cross-compiler package.

Enjoy!
