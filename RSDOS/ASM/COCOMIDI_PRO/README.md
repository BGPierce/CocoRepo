# CocoMIDI Pro

CocoMIDI Pro by Lester Hands

CocoMIDI Pro is a MIDI recorder/sequencer for the Tandy Color Computer 3 (RSDOS). CocoMIDI 3 allows you to record and edit 16 MIDI channels using the Speech Systems MIDI Pak (or the Glenside MIDI Pak).

Many features were added since CocoMIDI 3

CocoMIDI Pro compiles with the "AVMAC" assembler (commercial cross-assembler). I hope to soon convert this for EDTASM or Roger Taylor's CCASM

Enjoy!
