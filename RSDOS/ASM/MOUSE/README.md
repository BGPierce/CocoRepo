# Mouse

Mouse 1.0 by Steve Bjork

Mouse is a user definable "point-n-click" like interface for the Color Computer 1 & 2 in RSDOS. Featuring hi-rez text for the PMODE4 screen with a built-in mouse cursor.

Mouse was featured in the July, August, & September 1986 issues of Rainbow magazine (articles included, see the readme.txt for copyrights).

Mouse can be assembled with most Color Computer/RSDOS assemblers

Enjoy!
