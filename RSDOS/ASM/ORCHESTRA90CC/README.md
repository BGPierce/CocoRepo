# Orchestra90cc

Orchestra90cc by Jon Bokelman

The Orchestra90cc program pack allowed the user to program music in 5 voices over 6 octaves. The music playback was through the program pack's own dual (stereo) 8-bit DACs or through the Coco's TV sound out.

The Orchestra90cc was a ground breaking unit in it's day, and still amazes me today with the sound quality produced on the Color Computer.

This is ONLY the source for the Orchestra90cc ROM code. The actual program pack is needed to play music using this code. This source is still a work in progress, but currently will assemble to the exact duplicate of the original ROM code. The Orchestra90cc  runs on all models of the Color Computer with at least 16k of RAM.

A similar project is being undertaken by the members of the Dragon forum to convert this code to use a Dragon disk system and the Dragon keyboard matrix. If and when that project is finished and usable, I will most likely post that code as well.

Orchestra90cc can be assembled using Roger Taylor's CCASM in his RainbowIDE

Enjoy!
