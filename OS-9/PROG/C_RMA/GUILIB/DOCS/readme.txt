I have poured many  hours  of     work  into this library in hopes that people will use it  to     produce  really  easy to use, attractive software.   I  must     give credit to Shawn Driscoll.  He wrote GuiB which is a GUI     similar to mine written in basic09.  Thank you Shawn for the     inspiration.    Version  2  of  GuiLib  is  already  in  the     workings.   Daniel & I have many ideas that will make GuiLib     really  shine.  We will add new types of gadets and speed up     the  libray  considerably.    Also  in the works  is  a  GUI     editor  which will be a mouse driven programming aid.   With     this  program  you  will be able to design  GUI  screens  by     choosing  the  type of object you want and then  putting  it     onto  the screen where you want it.   It will then  generate     the  'C' code to impliment this screen design automatically.          This  library is distributed under the shareware  principal.     You may download it, use it, and may be distribute it freely     so  long  as it contains the full contents of  the  original     archive.

If you plan on doing any developing of commercial     software using the GUI you will be requied to compensate the     authors.       Thank you Daniel, thank you Shawn, and everyone enjoy!         James Delaney.     Introduction by Daniel Hauck:     My cohort neglected to mention that in the event you do appreciate     this or any subsequent GUI.L package, you are encouraged to help     compensate us for our efforts by sending contributions to the following     addresses:         Daniel S.
