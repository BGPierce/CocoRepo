Then load knights.b09 and pack it into yourCMDS directory also.Copy aif.kni and knights.dat to your data directory.Set the attribute of icon.knights to "e" and put it in yourCMDS/ICONS directory.Knights is a game where a chessboard is displayed on the screen and theplayer is given a knight to move around on the board.  The player startsthe game by placing the knight anywhere on the board.  He must then movethe knight to any valid square for his first move.  He must then do thesame thing for his next move, and so on.  The trick though is not to moveto a square that has already been moved to previously.  A player can't land on a square more than once and must not allow himself to get trappedduring play.The goal is to move the knight to each of the 64 squares.  The computerwill allow the player to UNDO his moves and also give hints to the player.The computer can be put into AUTO mode so that it makes the moves for theplayer.Another purpose of this game is to show an example of how GuiB works.The source code for both GuiB and Knights has been made available so youcan see how the graphic interface for Basic09 really works.Have fun!     --Shawn
