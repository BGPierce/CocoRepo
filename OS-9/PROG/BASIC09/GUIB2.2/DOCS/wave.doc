WAVE is a sample program that demonstrates one of the new featuresin GUIB v2.2.  The program uses the SCREEN command added in GUIB v2.2to find out the size of a window a program is running in.  WAVE canbe run alone or started from Multi-Vue's GSHELL.  An icon and AIF areincluded with the software.  The AIF allows users to resize a windowbefore WAVE is executed.  WAVE will automatically adjust its scalingto fit the window.WAVE should be run in a type 8 window and STDFONTS should be mergedinto memory.  The WAVE.B09 file should be packed into the CMDSdirectory.  GUIB.B09 is included for those that don't have it yet(v2.2 was distributed with the SHANGHAI OS-9 package).Shawn DriscollEARTHER@Delphi.com01/23/94
