# GPMap

GPMap by Homer Meyer

This is Homer Meyer's C conversion based on Kevin Darling's Basic09 utility by the same name. 

GPMap will display all Get/Put buffers in use on your OS-9 system, including those used by fonts, pointers, and patterns.

GPMap should compile with the standard Microware/Tandy C compiler

Enjoy!
