     I  have  made some modifications to Bruce Isted's  kutilprogram.   I  have  a Burke & Burke hard drive  system.   Themodifications I made allow me to easily replace the kernal onmy  hard  drive.  Instead of using fixed offsets, I read  thedisk  format  information  from the disk  and  calculate  theoffsets.   I used track 34 for floppys and track 128 for harddrive.   This should still work on partitioned drives.  I  amincluding  the  source  code with my modifications  for  yourperusal.  I  tried to make sure I didn't mess up any  of  thesections  that are used with other systems.  I tried to  markthe  changes  I  made  with my initials (DST)  to  assist  infinding  them.  I  have tested this on my system  by  gettingkernals  from  and placing kernals on my B&B hard  drive,  35track SS floppy and 40 track DS floppy with no malfunctions.      I  contacted Bruce and received permission to upload theprogram with modifications.                              Don Thrash               Delphi: DONTHRASH
