# MD

MD by T. Birt

MD is an OS9 "mdir" like utility that displays the system directory with color coded entries. Each color represents a different type system module i.e. boot, driver, descriptor, etc. A very nice utility

MD should compile with the standard Microware/Tandy C compiler using Carl Kreider's "clib.l"

Enjoy!
