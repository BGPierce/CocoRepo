# Maze

Maze 3 by Brian C. White

Maze draws a random maze on an OS9 hi-rez graphics screen, the proceeds to solve the maze. The procees repeats until interrupted. Maze is meant ot be a "screen-saver" of sorts.

Maze should compile with the standard Microware/Tandy C compiler using Carl Kreider's "clib.l"

Enjoy!
