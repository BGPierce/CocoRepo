# GUIB 2.2

Guib 2.2 by Shawn Driscoll

This is the third release of Shawn's Guib series.

Guib is an OS9/Basic09 utility that allows the Basic09 programmer to creat a "point-n-click" environment for their Basic09 programs.

Included is Shawn's "Wave" demo for GUIB 1.1

This being Guib's 3rd release, Shawn had added many features since 1.1, but by Guib 3.0, Shawn had created quit a unique utility.

Enjoy!
