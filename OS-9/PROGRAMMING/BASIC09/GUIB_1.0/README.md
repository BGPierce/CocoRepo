# GUIB 1.0

Guib 1.0 by Shawn Driscoll

This is the first release of Shawn's Guib series.

Guib is an OS9/Basic09 ustility that allows the Basic09 programmer to creat a "point-n-click" environment for their Basic09 programs.

Included is the "Knights" demo game for GUIB 1.0

This being Guib's first release, there very little functionality, but by Guib 3.0, Shawn had created quit a unique utility.

Enjoy!
