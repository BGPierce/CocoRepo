                            IconMan 01.00.00                        (c) 1991, Shawn DriscollAN OVERVIEW     This program is a handy tool for building icons for various Multi-Vue     applications.  A user can create new icons or edit existing ones.  The     interaction between the user and computer is performed by the use of a     mouse which simplifies the user's input.  If a mouse is not available,     the keyboard arrow keys can be used.SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS     o  512K TANDY Color Computer 3     o  OS-9 Level II     o  Multi-Vue (a working copy such as Gshell+ 1.24)     o  RGB monitor (optional)     o  1 or 2 button mouse (optional)INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE    The user should start Basic09 with #24k and load ICONMAN.B09 and pack it    into Multi-Vue's execution directory.  ICONMAN should then be killed off    so that GUIB11.B09 can be loaded and packed into the same directory.    The user should "merge runb gfx2 syscall inkey > newrunb" and delete    runb and rename newrunb to runb.  The user must then set the "e"    attribute for RunB and copy it into the execution directory.     AIF.ICM must be copied to a Multi-Vue folder that suits the user.     EARTH.SYS must be copied to /DD/SYS/EARTH.SYS.     ICON.ICONMAN should have its "e" attribute set and be copied to     Multi-Vue's icon directory.      PWD, ATTR, LOAD, and UNLINK must be either in memory or in the     execution directory.  SYS/StdPats_16 should be merged into memory     (best done during system startup).USING THE SOFTWARE     To start IconMan, the user must open the folder that contains the AIF     for IconMan and double-click on the IconMan icon.  This will tell Multi-     Vue to open a 40 x 24 window with 16 colors.  This window will be used     to edit or create icons.     The commands for IconMan are simple to use: "Clear", "Load", "Save",     "Info...", and "Quit".  The user simply clicks on the command he wants     to perform and IconMan will save his latest creation to disk or load a     previous one from his collection or create a new icon from scratch.     NOTE:  Users familiar with old software produced by EARTHER ENTERPRISES            will remember the EARTH.SYS file that came with the packages.            IconMan makes use of the EARTH.SYS file also, but with a few            modifications.  IconMan will search for and read EARTH.SYS from            the /DD/SYS  directory.  The file should contain at least:                       ICONS=/dd/cmds/icons                                The variable ICONS must be capitalized in order for IconMan to            recognize the entire line.  The pathname can be changed by the            user so that icons can be read and saved from a different            directory.            If the icon directory listed in the EARTH.SYS file does not            exist, then IconMan will use the current data directory.            If EARTH.SYS can't be found by IconMan or the variable ICONS            isn't located in EARTH.SYS, then IconMan will use Multi-Vue's            current data directory to read and save icon files.            REG is now another variable that can be put in the EARTH.SYS            file.  REG is used to assign colors to the 16 palette            registers.  This allows users to run applications using the            colors they like to see.  These lines can be added to a user's            EARTH.SYS file:                       REG00=333                       REG01=000                       REG02=003                       REG03=030                       .                       .                       .                       REG15=111            The 3-digit number assigned to each palette register is the            RGB value.            NOTE: IconMan uses only REG12 - REG15 for its GUI.  If it            can't find them, it assigns default settings for those            registers.  Other applications might use all 16 REGs, though.     To load an icon, a user simply clicks on the button marked "Load" and     IconMan will display all the icons it finds in the icon directory.     NOTE: IconMan only recognizes up to 300 filenames beginning with "icon."     or "ICON.".  The user can choose an icon from the list by clicking on     its name.  IconMan will then load the icon and quickly display it.  The     user can decide to edit the icon or load a different icon by clicking     on a different name or "Return" to the previous icon already being     edited.  The icon list can be scrolled through by clicking on the UP and     DOWN arrow buttons or by clicking above or below the scroll bar.     To edit an icon, the user must click on the button marked "Edit" after     IconMan has loaded an icon.  This tells IconMan to transfer the icon's     image to the blown-up work area.  By clicking inside the window, the     user can plot the various pixels which define the icon.  If the user     wants to use a different color, he can move the pointer to one of the     four colors located near the editing window and click on his choice.     Any further pixels plotted will be in that color.  Clicking button #2     on a two-button mouse will allow IconMan to cycle through the colors.     A small window is displayed to show the icon's actual size.      The user can click on the button marked "Chd" to change IconMan's icon     directory.     IconMan allows users to save icons anywhere on their system.  Users can     type "icon.supercomm" or "/d1/cmds/icons/icon.supercomm".  Users should     remember that IconMan can only load icons that have the prefix "icon."     attached to their names.     For users who do not use a mouse, the keyboard arrow keys can be used to     move the mouse pointer.  The user must press <CTRL>+<CLEAR> to switch     the control of the pointer over to the keyboard.     Have fun!     Shawn - 12/02/91
