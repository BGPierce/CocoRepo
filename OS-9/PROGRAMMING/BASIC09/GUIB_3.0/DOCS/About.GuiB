About GuiB 3.0     This is the latest release in the GuiB series originated by ShawnDriscoll(EARTHER on Delphi). I added several new windows, etchedlines, and additional gadgets. I've included a demo program based onShawn's original work with some of my own work.        To run the demo. first create a type 8 window. (Use mgw8 if you donot already have a script to create one.) Next load basic09 (mergedwith Syscall, Inkey and Gfx2). Then type basic09 #24k. Load Guib.b09,and pack it. Then kill it and load Demo.b09, pack that code also. Atthis point you can either type "Kill demo" or simply run it.This is a transitional release. I am sure that my code is not ascompact as it could be. This is due, mainly, to my lack ofprogramming expertise. I'm sure that with a little tweaking it couldbe much more efficient.      I've included the following files:           Readme.first    About.Guib - this file    GuiB3.b09 - the code     Demo3.b09 - the demo     GuiB3.doc - Documentation for GuiB 3_0.     Mgw8 - a shell script to make a type 8 window.        THE FUTURE I would like to change the bullets code to use icon style graphicsrather than draw the circles. I thought of perhaps using putstatements. If time permits, perhaps I will do a rewrite to workwith Pixel-Blaster. Some of the screen elements might be vef filesfor faster loading. You will notice in places that my demo is quiteslow. This may be more due to my programming sytle, or the lackthereof.        Study the source code, look up the examples, and please post anythingyou come up with.        WISH LIST       Some of the things I wish OS9-6809 would allow:     Other sized fonts     text not being limited to 8 pixel boundaries     proper circles with scaling off     A life of luxury for a monk who shall remain nameless.        With all best wishes,       Br.
