This program was featured in Sept 87, Oct 87, Nov 87, Dec 87, and Jan 88 issues of Rainbow. Please refer to these issues of Rainbow for instructions on compiling and running this program suite. I may eventually put together documentation based on the articles, so until then, please refer to Rainbow.

Enjoy!
