         Ulti-Box-III JukeBox version 4.7.1A by RAGTIMER  91/03/06This revision 'A' fixes a bug in 4.7.1 that played a lot of wrong notes(sharped or flatted) in older .UME scores.  And see note at end!Ulti-Box-III (UBox3) is a freeware "CD JukeBox" for UltiMusE (tm) files. UBox3 lets you select files to be played in any order.  You can interruptplay to pause, skip to the next piece, or even "request" another songwithout losing your place in the program.  Like UMusE3 itself, UBox3grabs 8K memory blocks as needed and can play scores using up to 32,767objects (notes, rests, etc.), if you have 8K of memory per 1020 objects.Unlike UltiMusE-III, UBox3 does NOT require VDGInt or Pipes in your Boot.This version plays Crescendo/Diminuendo, Accel/Ritard, and Articulationslike Staccato and Marcato, as found in scores of Level 7 or higher.Transposing values (in semitones up or down), saved in scores by UltiMusE4.7.0 or higher, are now observed by this UBox3, so you can save piecesto be played in any desired key or pitch.Feel free to upload and give away copies of UBox3 and anynon-copyrighted .ume score files, but NOT any other part of theUltiMusE-III system disk.STARTUPUBox3 must run in an 80x24 Text window.  Any 640-wide graphics windowwill work, but you'll see only 2 or 4 colors and some sub-windows won'tshow up as well.  Don't use the 32x16 UtiMusE-III green screen! Monochrome monitors may need the brightness turned way up.No  other files are needed (but see below).  Make sure UBox3  isLOADed  or in your current exec directory with the 'e' attr  set.Then just type:     ubox3or the full-blown command line:     ubox3 pathname optionswhere options include:     -s   Use Coco3's serial port with el-cheapo cable     -m   Use a MIDI Pak (must be Speech Systems compatible)Pathname  should be  a Directory of .ume files,  if  given.UBox3  will  start up in that directory.  But you can  change  toother directories later.If you have an UltiMusE-II preferences init file under"/DD/SYS/UM3.Init", UBox3 will set its modes from it, including theSerial, /MIDI device, MIDI-Pak, and Instrument Enables.  UBox3 can'tchange this file, however.COMMANDS MENUThe menu of command "buttons" is listed below the Selected window.  Topunch a button, just type its first character (shown in inverse video). No ENTER is needed.CHOOSING PIECES TO PLAYThe top (Red) window will list all the "Available" .ume files in thecurrent directory, showing an Index number for each, but not the .umeextension.  To select a file for play, type its index number and ENTER. It will now show in the (Green) Selected window, with a different Playnumber that tells in what order it will be played. To unselect a piece, type a minus sign, no space, its Play number, andENTER.  If you re-select such a piece, it will go to the far end of theSelected window list.Maybe someday the above will let a mouse point-and-click, like Umuse3.Some command buttons help you out:'a':  Select All pieces.'n':  Select None (turn all off); start over.'f':  Flip; all chosen pieces are turned off, and the reverse.      Handy  to  hear all but a few, or all the ones  you  didn't      play the last time.MODESEach Mode button flips (toggles, reverses) its mode on each hit:'s':  Enable MIDI output on the Coco's Serial port and cable.'m':  Enable MIDI output on a hardware MIDI Pak.'/':  Enable MIDI output thru a /MIDI device driver & descriptor.      The /MIDI driver and the MIDI Pak can't both be on at once,      so turning either on turns the other off if it was on.  But      the Serial port can be played along with either of the others.'i':  Instrument (Patch) Change enable.  If the pieces are set up      for your synth(s), you want this ON.  But to play some      downloaded MT-32 score on your Yamaha PSS-480, turn this      OFF  to  keep  pesky patch changes from messing  with  your      manual  patch  setups.   Note that some synths  have  panel      controls to filter out patch change bytes.  You can't edit      a score's MIDI channels or Instruments with UBox3.'l':  Loop, or repeat, all the chosen pieces forever.'w':  Set the Wait delay between pieces.  Nice for hard disk use.PLAYING THE STUFF'p':  Start playing.  Only the Selected (green) pieces will play, in the ordershown.  As each number plays, a pop-up window gives its title and otherinfo.  After each piece is played, it is inverse-videoed on the screen. Whenever you start play with 'p', all pieces are reset to unplayed, sothey all play again. 'c': Continue playing after an interruption.  Unlike 'p', this picks up withthe first yet unplayed number.'r':Request the "DJ" to play one piece, selected or not.  Type its Indexnumber if Available (unselected), or minus its Play number if selected. While it's playing, all usual controls will work.REAL-TIME CONTROLSDuring play, none of the menu command buttons work, but instead you havesome other controls:SHIFT key, held down by itself, doubles the speed (tempo).CONTROL  key  does  just the opposite; slow  motion.SHIFT-BREAK  or  CONTROL-C  (as in Continue) cuts the  piece  now     playing  and skips to the next one on the list.  If playing     the last piece or a Request, this returns to the Main Menu.BREAK pauses the play and gives you a Sub-Menu of options:     SPACE_BAR to un-pause and resume play;     ENTER to halt playing and return to Main Menu;       you can now Continue, or change selections, etc.     's' to reject this piece and Skip to next.MISCELLANEOUS'd':Directory of all files (not just .ume), a PWD, and a chance to type anew directory pathname.  Just ENTER to stay put.'o':Overlays an 80x24 window and expects an OS9 SHell command line.  Afterits output is shown, hit ENTER to return. But if you hit just ENTER forthe first command, it will stay in the Shell and you can keep talkingwith OS9 until you hit ESCape (CONTROL-BREAK) to return to UBox3. (Yes,this is the opposite of UMusE3.)'q':Cut off the soul, the blues, the good vibes; back to the day job.HINTSIf you have more than one synth, or one synth with different modes (likeMIDI MODE 00 or 99 on the PSS-480), you should make separate OS9directories for .UME files setup for each type or mode of synths.  Thenyou can play all pieces in a directory without fussing with the synthsor trying to remember what each piece is scored for.If you've downloaded a piece and have trouble playing it, you can use theold Shareware UltiMusE program (on a 32x16 green screen) to see what MIDIchannels and Instruments it's using.  But if you write the score backout, you will lose any notes after about the first 1500 and some otherfeatures, so for really fixing a piece up to play on your equipment youneed UltiMusE-III from Kala Software (formerly Second City Software). Sorry about the commercial, but "that's the way it is."If a piece goes to play (its title flashes in the yellow Info window) butinstantly goes away and UBox3 skips to the next piece, this meanssomething is wrong with that score file -- missing data off the end, orgarbage bytes near the beginning.  Sometimes happens with downloads. --The End.  Rest your eyes, try your ears.  Enjoy -- RAGTIMER.PS: Want to zap your synth into special modes?  Load System-exclusivesound programs?  Then download my new SerMIDI program that letsyou send any sequence of bytes over the el-cheapo serial cable!
