These folders contain Mike Knudsen's last sources for Ultimuse3 v09.11.2A.

Ultimuse3 is a 16 channel MIDI sequencer for the Coco3 and OS-9.

To compile Ultimuse3, a custom C compiler setup is required. I hope to soon upload Mike's custom compiler jus for these sources as well as a few others as I use this compiler system for all my C compiling chores.

Enjoy!
